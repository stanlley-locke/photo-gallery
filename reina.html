        <h1>Mi Reina ðŸ˜˜</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Whispers of the Heart<br>
Beneath the moon's soft silver glow,<br>
A quiet love begins to grow.<br>
Like petals in a gentle breeze,<br>
It dances through the whispered trees.<br>
The stars above, they seem to know,<br>  
The secrets of the heartâ€™s deep glow.<br>  
In silent nights and endless skies,<br>  
I find my peace within your eyes.<br>
Through every storm, through every tear,<br>  
You are the light that draws me near.<br>  
A love so pure, it can't be seen,<br>  
Yet in your touch, I am redeemed.<br>
So let the world spin on its way,<br>  
With you, my love, Iâ€™ll always stay.<br>  
For in your arms, I've found my home,<br>  
In you, my heart will never roam.</p>

  <p>So let the world spin on its way,<br>
With you, my love, Iâ€™ll always stay.<br>  
For in your arms, I've found my home,<br>  
In you, my heart will never roam.<br>
Through every chapter yet to unfold,<br>  
Together, our story will be told.<br>  
In love's embrace, weâ€™ll always find<br>
A bond unbroken, intertwined.</p>
